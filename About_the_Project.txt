### Project Overview

In this React Native bare project, I have created a test app that includes two screens: one for displaying a user list and another for showcasing posts created by users. 

**Key Features:**

1. User List Card Component: A dedicated component has been created for displaying user cards in the list.
2. Navigation Structure: The app includes a clear routing structure to manage navigation between screens.
3. Infinite Scroll: Implemented as per the requirement to load more items as the user scrolls.
4. Image Assets: Icons for view, like, and dislike actions have been included as image assets.
5. Scroll to Top Button: A user-friendly "scroll to top" button has been implemented for ease of access.
6. React Hooks:
   - useState: Used for state management.
   - useEffect: Utilized to fetch data from the API on the first load and to manage infinite scroll functionality as the item count increases.
   - useRef: Used in the "scroll to top" feature to reference the FlatList and invoke its properties.
   - useNavigation: From the React Navigation library, this hook is used to navigate to the post screen and pass parameters, such as user ID.
7. Custom Splash Screen and App Icon: A custom splash screen and app icon were created to honor the company for providing this opportunity.

This concludes the project description. Thank you, and have a nice day!
